    <h1>QuikChat Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        **Effective Date: December 12, 2025**
    </p>

    <p>
        QuikChat ("us," "we," or "our") operates the QuikChat random video chat service. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our service and the choices you have associated with that data.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data We DO NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Since QuikChat is a no-registration platform, we **do not** collect or store the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email addresses or phone numbers.</li>
        <li>User passwords or account credentials.</li>
        <li>Names or identity details (unless voluntarily entered in the "Name" input field).</li>
        <li>IP addresses for user identification purposes (only for real-time connection establishment).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect (Technical & Signaling)</h2>
    <p>
        We only collect the minimum amount of data necessary to provide and maintain the connection service:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Device Information:** We access your device's camera and microphone, but **only** with your explicit permission, to facilitate video and audio streams via WebRTC.</li>
        <li>**Real-Time Metadata (Signaling):** We use **Socket.IO** and our server to manage real-time data like:
            <ul>
                <li>Your selected Gender and Country filters.</li>
                <li>Temporary connection status (e.g., "Waiting for partner").</li>
                <li>Anonymous connection IDs to match partners.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**User-Reported Data:** If you use the 'Report' feature, we collect the reason for the report and the time, but this remains unlinked to your personal identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Video and Audio Communication (WebRTC)</h2>
    <p>
        QuikChat uses **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** technology for video and audio streams.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Peer-to-Peer (P2P):** Your video and audio data is transmitted **directly** between you and your chat partner (Peer-to-Peer). This media data **does not** pass through or get stored on our servers.</li>
        <li>**Encryption:** All WebRTC streams are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring your conversations remain private.</li>
        <li>**We DO NOT record or monitor your video/audio calls.**</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Cookies:** We use minimal local storage (like the name you enter) but generally avoid persistent cookies for tracking.</li>
        <li>**Analytics:** We use **Google Analytics** to understand general website traffic and user interaction (e.g., button clicks, page views). This data is anonymized and aggregated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>
